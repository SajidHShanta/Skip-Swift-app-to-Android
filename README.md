# Skip.tools Exploration
This repository explores [Skip.tools](https://skip.tools/), which enables Swift developers to create native iOS and Android apps using a single codebase.

## What is Skip?
Skip brings Swift app development to Android by allowing developers to:
- Write Swift code that compiles natively for both iOS and Android.
- Use Xcode as the primary development environment.
- Maintain a unified codebase for a seamless cross-platform experience.
- Ensure optimal performance with genuinely native Android execution.

## Repository Purpose
This repository serves as a playground to:
- Experiment with Skip's capabilities and limitations.
- Create sample projects demonstrating Swift-based cross-platform development.
- Document findings, best practices, and potential challenges.

## Getting Started
### Installation
To set up Skip on your macOS, ensure you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. Then, open Terminal and run:

```bash
brew install skiptools/skip/skip
```
